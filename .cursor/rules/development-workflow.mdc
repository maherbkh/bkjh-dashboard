# Development Workflow

- **Testing**: Always test components in isolation before integration. Verify functionality, accessibility, and responsive behavior.
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript strict mode. Enable all strict type checking options in tsconfig.json.
- **Commits**: Write descriptive commit messages. Follow conventional commit format for better changelog generation.
- **Review**: Review code for potential improvements before committing. Check for duplicated logic, missing types, and security issues.
- **Naming**: Use meaningful variable and function names. Names should clearly indicate purpose and usage.
- **Functions**: Keep functions small and focused. If a function does multiple things, break it into smaller functions.
- **Comments**: Document complex logic with comments. Explain why something is done, not what is done.
- **Edge cases**: Handle edge cases and error scenarios. Don't just code the happy path.
- **Error states**: Test error states and loading states. Verify that error handling works correctly.
- **Formatting**: Use consistent code formatting. Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configuration.
