# UI/UX Excellence

Implement strong UI/UX patterns with accessibility and user experience as top priorities.

- **Loading**: Provide clear loading states with skeleton loaders or spinners. Never leave users wondering if something is happening.
- **Errors**: Show meaningful error messages with recovery actions. Explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
- **Keyboard**: Use proper focus management and keyboard navigation. All interactive elements must be accessible via keyboard. Implement proper tab order and focus indicators.
- **Responsive**: Ensure responsive design across all breakpoints. Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Use Tailwind responsive prefixes consistently.
- **Accessibility**: Implement proper ARIA labels. Use semantic HTML. Provide screen reader support for dynamic content.
- **Motion**: Use transitions and animations purposefully. Respect user preferences for reduced motion.
- **Design system**: Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color usage. Follow the design system strictly.
- **Validation**: Validate forms with real-time feedback. Show validation errors when users blur from invalid fields.
- **Async actions**: Disable buttons during async operations to prevent double submissions. Show loading indicators on buttons during processing.
- **Success**: Show success confirmations for user actions (toasts, notifications, or inline messages).
