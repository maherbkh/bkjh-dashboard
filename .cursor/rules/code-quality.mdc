# Code Quality Standards

Write clean, maintainable code following SOLID principles.

- **Single responsibility**: Each component and composable should serve one purpose.
- **Open/closed**: Extend functionality without modifying existing code.
- **Liskov substitution**: Derived classes substitutable for base classes.
- **Interface segregation**: Keep interfaces focused and specific.
- **Dependency inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

## TypeScript

- Ensure strong TypeScript safety with zero warnings or errors.
- Never use `any`. Use proper type inference and explicit typing where needed.
- The only exception is v-html usage where necessary for typed content.

## No Duplication

- Avoid code duplication. Extract reusable logic into composables and utilities before creating new implementations.
- Always check existing composables in the composables directory for reusable global helpers and functions before making new ones.
