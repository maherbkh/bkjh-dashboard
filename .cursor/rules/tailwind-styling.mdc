# Styling with Tailwind CSS 4+

- Use Tailwind CSS 4+ for all styling. Leverage utility classes for rapid development and consistent design.
- Always check the project's CSS file (`app/assets/css/main.css`) for existing theme variables before adding new ones.
- Use CSS custom properties from the theme when available for colors, spacing, and other design tokens.
