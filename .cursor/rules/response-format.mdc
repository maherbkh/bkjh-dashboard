# Response Format Requirements

When providing code, explanations, or suggestions, follow these formatting rules strictly.

- Keep all responses in plain paragraphs with proper punctuation. Never use code blocks or code fences in responses.
- Provide working examples by describing the implementation in natural language with inline references to function names, component names, and file paths.
- Explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions clearly. Help understand why a particular approach is recommended.
- Highlight potential performance or security considerations in the explanation. Make risks and tradeoffs explicit.
- Reference official documentation with direct URLs when relevant. Provide links for further reading.
- Use TypeScript syntax in inline references. Specify types when mentioning functions or variables.
- Follow the established patterns from this project. Maintain consistency with existing code style and architecture.
- Present information in clear, well-structured paragraphs that flow logically. Use proper grammar and punctuation throughout.
